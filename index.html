                    <p>Madam West is an NYC-based rock band. With origins in synthpop, the group has since turned to infusing their songs with elements of prog, funk and psych. Their arrangements seek to find the sunlight that remains even in the darkest of times.</p>

                    <p>The group is a member of Brooklyn-based label and artist collective Floordoor Records (Public Speaking, A Bunch of Dead People, Supplier, Wsabi Fox) and Philadelphia-based goodhowareyou records (Blushed, Secret Nudist Friends, Broke Body). No Depression called the group's latest EP "a fine, wide-ranging release, packed with more in its six songs than most full length albums can hope to muster.</p>
